I was tasked with creating code that would allow users to generate unique passwords. User can choose length of password (8 t0 128 characters); these include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special symbols. During the creation of a password users will prompted with questions on how they would like their password generated. 

The code contains the following:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
